# Optimal-Feature-Configuration-for-Dynamic-Malware-Classification-Code
A tool that implements the process of feature extraction, model generation and statistical tests.

# Requirements
Since it uses autoskelarn, it will probably only work on Linux systems.

First, some autosklearn dependency packages must be installed. For the full story see: https://automl.github.io/auto-sklearn/master/installation.html

In short:
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential swig
```

Then install the required Python packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Execution
```
python main.py [args]
```

The file ``tool/settings.py`` contains several options to modify execution.

## Feature extraction
Pass the ``extraction`` option to the script. By default, the program will search ``BASE_DATA_PATH`` in ``settings.py`` to find directories with files to extract features from according to ``EXTRACTION_SCHEME``, which defines the extraction process.
By default, the resulting files will be output to the directory ``datasets``, in the base directory of the tool as defined in ``FEATURE_OUTPUT_PATH``.

## Model generation
Pass the ``generation`` option to the script. The files defined in ``MODEL_GENERATION_FILES_TO_LOAD`` will be used. If the files do not represent an absolute or relative path, they are searched for in ``FEATURE_OUTPUT_PATH``. They are expected to be in .csv format.
The options ``TARGET_COL`` and ``COLUMNS_TO_DISCARD`` define respectively the column with the labels of the dataset and the columns to be discarded. All other columns will be considered as features to train the model. 

``NUM_OF_TRIALS`` sets the number of iterations for each dataset and HPO algorithm specified in ``AUTOSKLEARN_HPO``. The output file contains information extracted from the generated models will se saved in ``INFO_OUTPUT_FILE`` which by default is
``info/info.csv`` in the the base directory of the tool.

## Statistics
By default searches in ``info/info.csv`` as defined in ``STATISTICS_INPUT_FILE`` for a csv file. It will carray out statistica tests to determine whether there are sttistically significant differences in the values of ``STATISTICS_DATA_COLUMNS`` for each of the groups defined by the values of ``STATISTICS_DESCRIPTIVE_COLUMNS``.
By default, several directories with results in .csv format will be created in the ``statistics`` directory in the base directory of the tool.
